# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that provides structure and notes related to bootcamp prework topics so students can easily access the information.

Bootcamp prework covers HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, which is a large amount of information to cover in a short time. The study guide webpage  provides structure to all material covered in the prework modules.
